# Introduction to Femscript

Femscript is a simple scripting language created as a personal project to learn Rust. It is asynchronous, allowing you to execute Femscript code in Python, exchange Python values with Femscript, and vice versa, all with seamless integration.

## Features

- **Asynchronous:** Femscript is designed to be asynchronous, ensuring it does not block the execution of the main code.
- **Easy Integration with Python:** Executing Femscript code in Python is straightforward, and binding functions and passing variables between Python and Femscript is simple.
- **Lightweight:** The project is lightweight and easy to set up, making it suitable for quick prototyping and integration into existing projects.

## Example Uses

Here are a few example use cases for Femscript:

- **Adding Custom Commands in a Discord Bot:**
  Femscript can be used to allow users to write their own custom commands for a Discord bot. With the ability to easily bind functions and pass variables between Python and Femscript, you can integrate scripting functionality directly into your bot.

- **Feel free to come up with your own use cases:**
  Since Femscript is flexible, you can think of many different ways to use it. The possibilities are yours to explore!

## What Uses Femscript

- **Fembot Discord Bot:**
  Femscript is used in the [Fembot Discord Bot](https://github.com/poligonteam/cenzura) to allow dynamic scripting and custom command handling.
